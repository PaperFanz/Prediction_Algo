# Prediction_Algo
2017 Seimens submission program for predicting user motions on the fly and rendering haptic feedback for guidance and detraction.

NOTE: This repo does not include any of the makefiles or libraries needed to compile the project.
If you are interested, please look into the Chai3D API, which was used for both graphics and
haptic force rendering, including UI design, math libraries, and thread management functions.
